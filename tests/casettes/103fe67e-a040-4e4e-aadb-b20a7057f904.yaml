        Capital, a week after announcing a $10 million seed investment from Benchmark.[3][4]\\n
        The project quickly garnered popularity, with improvements from hundreds of
        contributors on GitHub, trending discussions on Twitter, lively activity on
        the project's Discord server, many YouTube tutorials, and meetups in San Francisco
        and London. As of April 2023, it can read from more than 50 document types

        so you can do a lot of things like reflection and kind of like making sure
        that you're on the right track and really put more safeguards and thinking
        about these agents as opposed to relying on like chas and interface, like
        the bot we have that's on GitHub answering questions on the issues, I think
        probably gives better answers than the bots that we have that are on chat
        on the website. [00:50:32]\\nHarrison: And then between kind of like allowing
        for, I think one helpful thing that we did in terms of like distinguishing
        between basically the base interfaces and then more complex stuff is part
        of the separation around the docs is there's like the components piece, which
        has the model IO, the retrieval, the agents, the callbacks, things like that.
        And then like, I know a lot of people are doing this, but like a personal
        assistant for like managing like email calendar, basic stuff, which I think
        is, I think that's like a fantastic application for these like agent like
        things, because if you think about personal assistants today, you usually

      their heralded power and versatility, LLMs have important limitations: namely,
      a lack of up-to-date information, a lack of domain-specific expertise and a
      general difficulty with math.\\nLangChain tools\u00a0(link resides outside ibm.com)
      are a set of functions that empower LangChain agents to interact with real-world
      information in order to expand or improve the services it can provide. Launched
      by Harrison Chase in October 2022, LangChain enjoyed a meteoric rise to prominence:
      as of June 2023, it was the single fastest-growing open source project on Github.1
      Coinciding with the momentous launch of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT the following
      month, LangChain has played a significant role in making generative AI more
      accessible to enthusiasts in the wake of its widespread popularity.\\n Reimagine

      input and composes a natural language response, it\u2019s the application that
      (among other things) provides an interface for the user to type and read and
      a UX design that governs the chatbot experience.\"}, {\"url\": \"https://www.basedash.com/blog/langchains-origin-story\",

      around the docs is there''s like the components piece, which has the model IO,
      the retrieval, the agents, the callbacks, things like that. And then like, I
      know a lot of people are doing this, but like a personal assistant for like
      managing like email calendar, basic stuff, which I think is, I think that''s
      like a fantastic application for these like agent like things, because if you
